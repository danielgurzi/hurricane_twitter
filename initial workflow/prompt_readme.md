# Project_5

Overview
We've organized for you to complete a client project. This is a great opportunity for you to be exposed to a real organization doing real work with real data.

The Organization:

New Light Technologies is a small, award-winning organization based in Washington, D.C. that provides solutions to government, commercial, and non-profit clients. NLT is a team of dedicated technologists, scientists, engineers, designers, and strategists working on some of the most interesting, challenging, and important assignments in the world, ranging from disaster response to enabling growing telecommunications networks to providing healthcare to Americans. Some of the organizations they work with include FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), USAID (the United States Agency for International Development), the U.S. Census Bureau, and The World Bank.

Ran Goldblatt, our contact with NLT, is a remote sensing scientist and senior consultant. He has a strong background in geographic information systems (GIS) and leverages this knowledge when solving problems facing various agencies.

The Work:

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on:

preparing for emergencies,
rapidly responding to emergencies, and/or
estimating the economic impact of disasters.
The goal is for you to leverage your skills to help solve real-world problems. NLT has identified twelve potential prompts of value to them. You may pick one and attempt to solve it. Alternatively, if you would like to edit the problem slightly (for example, picking a different data source) or combine multiple prompts together, you may do that as well!

Leveraging Social Media to Map Disasters.
Leveraging News and Media for Situational Awareness.
Optimizing Evacuation Routes using Real-Time Traffic Information.
Using Google Street View to retrieve (pre-event) photos of structures.
Using news outlets and/or social media to identify areas/neighborhoods with power outages.
Using live police radio reports for real time identification of people needing assistance.
Using Indeed or Glassdoor platforms together with number and type of affected businesses to estimate the expected economic loss (wages) due to a disaster.
Crowdsourcing Damage Photos
Finding Tents and Other Emergency Housing Through Exploitation of Satellite Imagery
Updating Shelter Status
Identifying Misinformation in Disaster-Related Social Media Posts
Extracting Flood Depths from Imagery
Improve Slum Area Identification through Real-Estate Data
Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Social Media Posts
Mapping Hotspots of COVID-19 Cases
Identifying Areas At Risk for COVID-19 and Other Natural Disasters
Mapping Available Commodities During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Chicago Case Study: Hotel Availability for Quarantine
The Data:

For this project, you aren't given any data! You are given possible sources for data, but don't feel limited by this. Be creative in where and how you gather data!

Is there data easily downloadable into a .csv or .json file?
Can you get access to a database of data?
Can you access an API?
Do you need to build a scraper? Be sure to consider any legal, regulatory, and ethical issues when accessing data!
As with the Reddit project, it's important to identify source(s) for your data early and gather as soon as possible, as this might be a large bottleneck toward completing a project.

This is where you come in:

For the next three weeks, our class will tackle various projects related to emergency preparedness and economic analysis. On Friday, June 19, we'll present our findings and deliver:

A clean GitHub repo containing our reproducible results and analysis.
A real-world demonstration of the product.
Any documentation for running the code.
This is an exciting opportunity to identify and solve a problem relevant to the real world problems. Using your data science skills in this practical, pro bono capacity reflects well on you and gives you a great story as you embark on interviews! (The fact that we'll be using open data also gives you free reign to publicly publish your findings and to freely discuss this in interviews.)


Problem 11: Identifying Misinformation in Disaster-Related Social Media Posts

Problem Statement: While social media increasingly becomes the first source of information about disasters, this information is not always correct. Posts can be misleading or mistaken. On rarer occasion, users intentionally spread misinformation. How can emergency management agencies identify incorrect information before, during, and after disasters?

Proposed Deliverables:

A short write up describing the project, results, and next steps or proposal to scale
Open source code for identifying rumors among relevant social media posts
Proof of concept or pilot from a recent disaster
Descriptions of input data:
